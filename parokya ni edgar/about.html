        Parokya ni Edgar (lit: Edgar's Parish) is a Filipino band formed in
        1993. The band is known for its original rock novelty songs and often
        satirical covers of popular songs both foreign and local. The band is
        adept at playing in various musical genres.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parokya ni Edgar has been referred to by local media outlets and
        numerous award-giving bodies as "Pambansang Banda ng Pilipinas" (The
        National Band of the Philippines). Despite having "Edgar" in the band's
        name, none of the members are named Edgar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally named Comic Relief, the band's initial members were a group
        of high school students composed of vocalists Chito Miranda, Jeric
        Estaco, and Vinci Montaner, along with guitarists Mikko Yap and Gab Chee
        Kee, all hailing from Ateneo de Manila University. They were regulars in
        after-school jam sessions, before performing an opening number for an
        Eraserheads concert. This served as their break in the music industry
        and prompted them to add a drummer and bassist – Ateneo schoolmate
        Dindin Moreno and Miranda's childhood friend Buwi Meneses, respectively.
        Around the same time they changed the band's name to Parokya ni Edgar.
        After high school, Mikko and Jeric withdrew from the band to pursue
        other interests. Soon after, the remaining band members invited Darius
        Semaña, Meneses's former bandmate, to take the role of lead guitar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The band name's origin had been a subject of debate among fans as the
        band members had never given full confirmation. It was not until 2013
        that Chito Miranda officially addressed it through a post on their
        Facebook page. The title "Parokya Ni Edgar" came from a joke a classmate
        named Bambi Cuna made during one of their high school classes. Sources
        state that the class subject was Filipino. When the teacher asked Cuna
        where Jose Rizal's fictional hero, Crisostomo Ibarra (in the novel Noli
        Me Tangere) was educated, it was said that Cuna made up a daft answer,
        "sa Parokya ni Edgar". Then vocalist Jeric Estaco decided on impromptu
        to introduce the band as "Parokya ni Edgar" in their first live
        performance. From there, the band name just stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the late 1990s, PNE became regular performers in Club Dredd, a
        popular club in Manila at the time. The band slowly gained popularity
        during the height of the Filipino rock explosion, with the local rock
        community welcoming the influence of foreign grunge acts such as
        Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.

        Eventually, the late managing director of Universal Records, Bella Dy
        Tan, signed them as contract artists after witnessing one of their Club
        Dredd performances. Soon, their initial recordings "Buloy", "Trip
        (Siopao Na Special)" and "Lutong Bahay (Cooking Ng Ina Mo)" gained radio
        airplay. Their first album, Khangkhungkherrnitz(1996) became a triple
        platinum hit in the Philippines, having sold 120,000 units. The next
        albums were equal successes - Buruguduystunstugudunstuy (1997) was
        awarded triple platinum, Jingle Balls Silent Night Holy Cow (1998) with
        gold, and Gulong Itlog Gulong (1999) with triple platinum. This included
        the single "Halaga", one of the most popular songs in their career.
        "Halaga" was such a hit in the country that it further boosted PNE's
        career, cementing their name into OPM history.[3]

        After a five-year hiatus, they released their junior studio album Edgar
        Edgar Musikahan in 2002. On July 14, 2003, they released the studio
        album Bigotilyo, with the main single "Mr. Suave". "Mr. Suave" proved to
        be just as popular as its predecessors and stayed on the music charts
        for more than a year. The song became so popular in the Philippines that
        a few commercials and political campaigns borrowed stanzas from it. Same
        Year in 2003, Parokya celebrated their 10th Year Anniversary with new
        gigs and concerts in various shows in the Philippines and also around
        the world like Hong Kong, Canada such as Alberta, British Columbia,
        Ontario & more Canadian provinces tour were performed for PNE, and the
        United States such as New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, Arizona, California
        and among other U.S. States. were performed by PNE.

        2004 was the year of release of Inuman Sessions Vol. 1, PNE's first
        compilation DVD album celebrating their 11th anniversary. The DVD
        showcased the band's prerecorded live studio performance of their hit
        songs to a selected audience. The DVD album met success in sales
        nationwide. They released their 9th studio album, Middle-Aged Juvenile
        Novelty Pop Rockers in 2010 with the single "Paki-usap Lang (Lasingin
        Nyo Ako)". The album was met with moderate success in both charts and
        sales. In 2011, PNE joined the roster of Tanduay's First Five and
        RockFest replacing long running Tanduay endorser 6cyclemind.

        The following year, PNE released their 2nd compilation DVD album Inuman
        Sessions Vol. 2 - a follow up to their Inuman Sessions Vol. 1. Later
        that same year, Montaner officially left the band on good terms with
        both the members and crew. 2013 marked PNE's 20th anniversary in the OPM
        industry. The band launched their 13th album Bente as commemoration, and
        as this was a milestone, Vinci Montaner temporarily reunited with the
        band for the album's cover art and signings. In 2014, PNE was awarded
        with the MYX Magna Award for their artistic contribution to OPM Rock
        History & also celebrating their 20th anniversary of their opm rock band
        of the mid 90's. They are the 2nd OPM Rock Band to receive this award
        after Eraserheads in 2009.

        All throughout 2015, the band toured selected cities in the United
        States; they headlined at the Landmark Loews Theater in Jersey City, New
        Jersey on March 21, 2015.[4] That same year, the band began recording
        for their next album and contained the tracks "Sing" and "Lagi Mong
        Tatandaan", the former featuring Rico Blanco. The album is entitled Pogi
        Years Old. The cover album was revealed on September 2, 2016 through
        their Facebook page and expected to be released by 2016. Former member
        Vinci Montaner will appear on the album as a featured artist.[5] On
        September 9, 2016, the band held a free surprise show at the Bonifacio
        Shrine in Manila. [6] The album was released on October 17, 2016
        nationwide and on digital format.[7] The band would held an album launch
        at Eastwood Central Plaza on October 16, 2016. This marks the return of
        Vinci Montaner, who would join permanently days later.[8] On November
        22, 2017, Parokya was now named as the newest celebrity music star
        inductee in the 2017 Eastwood City Walk of Fame in Eastwood City Mall
        Quezon City for their influence in Pinoy rock music. Parokya was the 3rd
        related music group and 1st OPM Rock band to be inducted to the Eastwood
        City Walk Of Fame. [9] [10] Parokya Ni Edgar also recently celebrated
        their 25th silver anniversary last October 2018 following with more
        concerts and more new gigs to come.
